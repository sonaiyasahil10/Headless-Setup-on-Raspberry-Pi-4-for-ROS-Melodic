# ROS-Melodic-Installation-on-Raspberry-Pi-4

Needless to say before installing ROS on your Raspberry Pi 4 you will need an Operating System to be installed on which later ROS-Melodic will be installed.

There are many OS available out there but in this section we will be installing Raspbian Buster (Debian 10) which is no longer a stable release but right now is the latest OS for ROS-Melodic instalation.

Also we will be trying with a headless setup i.e, we will try to install the Raspbian OS without the need of an extra Display, Keyboard or mouse.


Raspbian is a free Debian-based operating system optimized for the Raspberry Pi, and Buster is the development code name for Debian 10. In this guide, we'll download and install Raspbian Stretch for use on the Raspberry Pi.
